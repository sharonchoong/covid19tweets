# Visualizing Covid-19 tweet data
A data visualization of the growth of interest in Twitter COVID-19 tweets over time by geography, in d3.js.  

Data is from Kaggle. Because of the amount of data, data was processed in Python ("server-side") before the visualization in client-side Javascript.

Country codes were converted from Alpha 2 codes to ISO 3166-1 numeric codes for the World Atlas TopoJSON using the Wiki page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1]().  Kosovo had to be excluded as it had no numeric code.
